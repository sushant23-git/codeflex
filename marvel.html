              <p class="ability-description">
                Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, relies on his highly advanced powered armor suit to give him incredible abilities. The suit grants him superhuman strength, durability, and the power of flight, allowing him to soar through the skies at supersonic speeds. It is equipped with a vast array of advanced weaponry, including repulsor blasts, missiles, lasers, and various other tools for both offensive and defensive purposes. Beyond his suit, Tony Stark’s genius-level intellect is his greatest asset. A brilliant inventor and engineer, he constantly upgrades his armor and designs new technology to overcome any challenge. Stark’s mind, combined with the technology of his suit, makes Iron Man a formidable force, capable of handling both physical threats and complex situations with ease.

              <p class="ability-description">
                The Hulk, also known as Bruce Banner, possesses immense superhuman strength, which grows exponentially with his level of anger. As the Hulk, he has nearly unlimited physical power, allowing him to lift and smash objects of colossal size, punch through solid structures, and overpower the most formidable opponents. His durability is equally impressive, as his skin and body can withstand extreme levels of damage, making him nearly invulnerable to physical attacks, explosions, and even radiation. The Hulk also has superhuman speed, agility, and stamina, despite his massive size. His healing factor allows him to recover from injuries at an accelerated rate. While Bruce Banner is a brilliant scientist, the Hulk is driven by pure emotion, making him unpredictable and uncontrollable, but also one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.

              <p class="ability-description">
                Thor, the God of Thunder, possesses extraordinary abilities that make him one of the most powerful heroes in the Marvel Universe. As an Asgardian, he has superhuman strength, speed, and durability, allowing him to withstand immense physical punishment and engage in battles with formidable foes. Thor wields the enchanted hammer Mjölnir, which grants him the power to summon lightning and storms, control weather, and fly by hurling it and propelling himself through the air. His mastery over lightning allows him to unleash devastating electrical attacks on his enemies. In addition to his combat skills, Thor has a deep connection to Asgardian magic, enabling him to perform various magical feats. His warrior spirit, combined with his noble heart and sense of duty, drives him to protect both Earth and Asgard from threats, embodying the qualities of honor, bravery, and sacrifice.

              <h2 class="ability-title">Spider Man</h2>
              <p class="ability-description">
                Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, possesses a unique set of abilities that make him one of the most iconic superheroes in the world. His powers are the result of a radioactive spider bite, which gave him enhanced strength, speed, and agility far beyond that of a normal human. One of his signature abilities is his "spider-sense," a heightened sensory awareness that warns him of danger before it happens, allowing him to react quickly in combat or avoid threats. Spider-Man can also cling to almost any surface, enabling him to scale walls and ceilings with ease. His web-shooters, which he invented himself, allow him to swing across the city, creating webs strong enough to ensnare enemies or create makeshift traps. In addition to these abilities, Peter Parker's intelligence and scientific prowess help him outsmart even the most formidable foes, making him not just a powerful hero but a brilliant strategist. Despite his superhuman powers, Spider-Man remains grounded by his sense of responsibility, using his abilities to protect others while dealing with personal struggles, embodying the ethos: "With great power comes great responsibility."
